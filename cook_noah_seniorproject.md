# Senior Project Proposal for Noah Cook
##  Proposal Sections
### Personal Background

I have taken Math 425, CSE450, CSE 451.  I did not take Math 488 because Professor Brother J Hathaway waived it and had me be a project manager for it instead.  I have TA'd for both CSE 450 and CSE 451.  I was a project manager for DSS.  My byui email is coo19002@byui.edu  My plans after graduation are to get a job in this field and eventually get a Master's and possibly a Doctorate.

### Project Background

I have been programming for about six years and have tried different projects and languages.  My favorite area so far has been machine learning.  The things machine learning has been able to accomplish borders on magic.  I want to see what the current limits of the field are and how hard it would be for someone new to get into them.

### Domain to Investigate

My domain is gonna be machine learning.  It is pretty vague, but I would like to investigate areas of machine learning that I have not researched.  One such area is autoencoding.  

### Proposed Deliverables

* Create a web page for hosting projects I have done
* Add examples of projects that I have done to that web page
* Add inputs for the user to use so that they can play with the models I have made
* Stretch Goal: Make the web app into a stand alone .exe or application that can run on any Windows 10 device and be sent over email.

### Faculty Request

Professor Brother J Susan Hathaway, Professor Sister Katie ~~Larson~~ Allen, Brother Palmer? or Brother Saunders? **I don't really know that many faculty all that well...**
